                    <img src="./assets/artists/lady-donli.jpg" class="artist-img" alt="lady donli">
                    <p class="paragraph">Elegant Lady Donli. Her music is fun to listen to. Incredibly vivacious 
                        and spirited, a motif that almost everyone can enjoy that incorporates poppy and 
                        Palmwine themed vibes. Overall positive energy and cool music. 
                        She is a mainstay of the Alté culture and a very accomplished artist. 
                        Anyone looking to gain a sense of the Alté  scene should check out Lady Donli 
                        because her songs give you the Alté feel, but not too much at once so you don't feel overwhelmed.
                         Totally recommend!

                    <p class="paragraph">Another skilled Alté creator who combines trap music with a retro aesthetic is Maison2500. 
                        He consistently writes original, good music. Whenever Maison is a featured artist on a track, I can always expect a banger; that's how good he his.
                        He sounds like the love child of Playboi carti and Alté. (By the way, Playboi carti is the GOAT.) 
                        His beats are always on target and are also a lot of fun to listen to. Maison can be a great introduction 
                        to the Alté genre if you like trap music.

                    <p class="paragraph">The best duo in the Alté game is Show Dem Camp (Tec and Ghost). 
                        Their music embodies coolness! Their songs make you simply want to unwind and enjoy Alté without 
                        worrying about anything.  The atmosphere when their song on is just unrivaled. I often find myself singing along 
                        to their songs as if I were on a karaoke set. They also have unparalleled rapping skills, 
                        and their bars are playful and melodic. Show Demp Camp is must listen for literally anyone.

                    <img src="./assets/artists/ragz-originale.jpg" class="artist-img" alt="Ragz Originale">
                    <p class="paragraph">The only producer in the the list and for good reason. I found out recently about Originale from another artist, 
                        whose name I'll mention later, and I can't get enough of his music. His features are just too superb, 
                        and his production quality is on par many more well-known producers. Originale is seriously underrated. 
                        He consistently makes good beats and he has a good sense of what good beats should sound like.
