                    Simply put, this EP is a masterclass. Every song is a hit, no joke. Peak vibe on this record. It seemed like a masterpiece when I first listened to it, and it still does today. 
                    Benjiflow cemented his status as a superstar to watch out for with this EP. Nothing I could ever say could possibly do this EP enough credit. I love each and every song on this EP. 
                    I now make it a habit to listen to at least one song each day, and I've never found it to be monotonous. Nothing compares to the best Alte EP.

                    In all honesty, Mandy and the Jungle and this album are tied for the top spot. The record is a top-notch piece of work with a phenomenal vibe. 
                    When I'm in the mood for Afrobeat music, this is my go-to song. It's arguable that this album, Odunsi's best to date, has aged nicely. From Star Sign to Alte Cruise, 
                    every song is a hit. If Santi hadn't been my favorite Alte artist, this album most likely would have been in first place. If you like Afrobeats then you'll definitely (I'm confident you will) enjoy this album.

                <h3 class="album-name">(1) Mandi and The Jungle</h3>
                <img src="./assets/album covers/mandi-and-the-jungle.jpg" alt="mandi-and-the-jungle">
                <p class="paragraph">  Experimentation at it's finest. Santi does not fail to impress on any level with this album, 
                    which hits on a completely new level. This album was incredibly innovative for its day. Even today, it still has 
                    a unique and fresh sound. Since listening to it is unlike anything else, I always return to it at least once a month. 
                    Overall, this is a good album, and in my humble opinion, Santi's best work.
