                    Very short but ultimately enjoyable EP by Odunsi (The Engine). It's fine and I enjoy it.
                     It could have been higher if the tracks were more fully developed, but even so, 
                     it's still a cool and enjoyable piece of music.

                    My preferred Altétrap-esc vibe is Maseworld. Finding hidden gems like this amid the sea of Alté records is 
                    always a treat because not many Alté musicians produce this style of music. The album is good, and 
                    listening to it was enjoyable in general.

                    Enjoy your life was the gem that introduced me to Lady Donli and I will always love this album.  
                    It was a brand-new and exciting experience when I first heard it. I make an effort to save the record 
                    and play it a few times within a month in order to preserve its charm. It's a classic and is a lot of fun.

                    I know this may sound controversial because so many people like to criticise this album, 
                    but I'm going to say it anyhow: Subaru Boys is at least an 8/10. You heard me!  Go and cry now! 
                    (lmao) In all seriousness, the album sounded strange to me at first, but Santi managed to work his magic 
                    and it has since been my go-to music. His work is always engaging and fun even if it isn't lyrically inclined. 
                    While some would argue that it isn't on the same level as Santi's other works, 
                    this is still up there and is certainly entertaining to listen to.

                    It's simply enjoyable and fun. She has a Cruel Santino feature on this record, so of course the 
                    features are excellent, the cadence is perfect, sound is sublime; you get the drift.

                    Benjiflow cemented his status as a superstar to watch out for with this EP. 
                    Nothing I could ever say could possibly do this EP enough credit. I love each and every song on this EP.

                    In all honesty, Mandy & the Jungle and this album are tied for the top spot. The record is a top-notch piece of work with a phenomenal vibe. 
                    When I'm in the mood for Afrobeat music, this is my go-to album. It's arguable that this album, Odunsi's best to date, has aged nicely. From "Star Sign" to "Alte Cruise", 
                    every song is a hit. If Santi hadn't been my favorite Alte artist, this album most likely would have been in first place. If you like Afrobeats then you'll definitely (I'm confident you will) enjoy this album.

                <p class="paragraph">  Experimentation at it's finest. Santi does not fail to impress on any level with this album, 
                    which hits on a completely new level. This album was incredibly innovative for its day. Even today, it still has 
                    a unique and fresh sound. Since listening to it is unlike anything else, I always return to it at least once a month. 
                    Overall, this is a good album, and in my humble opinion, Santi's best work.
